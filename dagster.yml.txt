📌 What is dagster.yaml?

It is the Dagster Instance Configuration File.

Dagster needs a directory called DAGSTER_HOME to store all runtime metadata:

Stored Data	Why it matters
Runs history	UI shows your pipeline history
Asset metadata	Freshness timestamps, lineage tracking
Schedules, sensors state	Persistent automation
Logs	Debugging + alerting
Event records	Observability
